== Biography

I'm a Ph.D. student at the [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk Department of Computer Science and Engineering],  
[http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)], 
under the supervision of [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~byu/ Prof. Bei Yu] since Spring 2026.

Previously, I received Master of Science from [https://engineering.yale.edu/academic-study/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering Department of Electrical Engineering] at [https://www.yale.edu/ Yale University] in 2025,
and Bachelor of Science from [https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm School of the Gifted Young] at [http://www.ustc.edu.cn/ USTC] in 2023.

My research interests include machine learning and deep learning with applications in lithography simulation and optical proximity correction, specifically for the advanced nodes.

Before coming to CUHK, I worked on developing quantum-limited parametric amplifiers beyond the conventional sub-10 GHz frequency range.
